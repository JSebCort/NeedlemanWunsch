Welcome. 

To start the program, download the Algorithms files and GUI.py. 

Run the GUI.py file. It is important to have numpy installed. 

On the left-hand side there are options to import two files for comparison,
choose which algorithm to run, and the scoring system. There are defaults 
already in place, but are changable. 

When ready, hit "Run". 

The files chosen will appear in the respective textboxes. 
The output will appear just below with a timer on how
long the algorithm took to run and score of the sequence.
