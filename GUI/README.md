GUI parsing is simple, if its an AGTC then we add it, if not, we add a dash as a placeholder. I was not sure if I should delete it or not. 

Output shows score and suppose to show difference but the algorithms do not output differences. 

My GUI works with the version of code I've uploaded with my GUI.
