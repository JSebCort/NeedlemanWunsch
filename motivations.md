# Motivations of the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm

  The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm that solves the global alignment problem of protein
and nucleotide sequences. The global alignment of sequences finds the way to align two whole
sequences, so that they are most similar. Local alignment finds parts of two sequences that are
the most similar. To find similarities, we keep a score that decreases for a gap or a mismatch
and increases for a match.

  Biologists used aligned sequenced DNA sequences to compare the similarity of them.
Biologist can find common ancestry. With finding common ancestry, doctors can tell patients
the likelihood of getting certain diseases. Also, biologists can detect functional equivalence in
certain parts of DNA sequences. Software that can align DNA sequences makes this possible do
to how large these sequences can be. A considerable amount of what biologists know about
DNA sequences has been discovered in the past 50 years, due to the fact it was not possible
without computers.
